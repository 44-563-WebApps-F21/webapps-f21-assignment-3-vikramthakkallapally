        <h1> BATMAN </h1>
        <P>
        Batman doesn't have any superhuman powers, but relies on high tech gear, martial arts, and high intelligence.<br>
        His special gear for fighting crime is often stored in his utility belt.<br>
        The one and only superpower I have is forgetting things too easily.
